  "howSalaryAfterTaxWorksGermany": "Salary after tax in Germany involves several mandatory deductions from your gross pay. Income tax is calculated using progressive tax brackets based on your taxable income. Social security contributions include health insurance (7.3% for employees), pension insurance (9.3%), unemployment insurance (1.2%), and nursing care insurance (1.525%). These contributions are shared between employees and employers, but the calculator shows the employee portion. Optional deductions like additional health insurance or private pension contributions can further reduce your taxable income and increase your take-home pay.",
