  "intro": "Calculate your bonus tax in Ireland with our comprehensive calculator. Bonuses are a significant part of many Irish salaries, but understanding how they're taxed is crucial for accurate financial planning. Unlike regular salary, bonuses are taxed at your marginal PAYE rate, potentially pushing you into higher tax brackets. This calculator uses official 2026 Revenue.ie rates to show you exactly how much tax you'll pay on bonuses, including PAYE income tax, Universal Social Charge (USC), and Pay Related Social Insurance (PRSI) contributions. Whether you're expecting a year-end bonus, performance bonus, or other supplemental pay, this tool helps you understand your true take-home bonus amount and overall compensation package.",

  "howThisCalculatorWorks": "This Ireland bonus tax calculator determines your take-home bonus by adding the bonus to your annual salary, then calculating Irish taxes on the total amount. Bonuses are taxed at marginal rates - if your base salary puts you in the 20% bracket but the bonus pushes you into the 40% bracket, the entire bonus is taxed at 40%. The calculator shows both the bonus tax breakdown and your total salary including bonus, helping you understand the overall tax impact. Irish bonuses are typically paid as a lump sum and taxed under the PAYE system with USC and PRSI calculated on total earnings. Some employers offer salary sacrifice schemes for bonuses, which may offer tax advantages.",
