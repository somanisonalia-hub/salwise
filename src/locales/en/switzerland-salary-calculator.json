  "howSalaryAfterTaxWorksSwitzerland": "Salary after tax in Switzerland involves several mandatory deductions from your gross pay. Income tax is calculated at both federal and cantonal (regional) levels, with each canton having its own tax rates and brackets. Social security contributions include AHV (old age and survivors insurance), IV (disability insurance), and EO (unemployment insurance), which are mandatory for all employees. Optional deductions like additional pension contributions (pillar 3a) can further reduce your taxable income and increase your take-home pay. The result is your net salary - the actual amount you'll receive in your bank account.",
