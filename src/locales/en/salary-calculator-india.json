  "howSalaryAfterTaxWorksIndia": "Salary after tax in India involves several mandatory deductions from your gross pay. Income tax is calculated using progressive tax slabs based on your annual taxable income. Professional tax varies by state, ranging from ₹0 to ₹2,400 annually. Employees contribute 12% of basic salary to Provident Fund, matched by employer contributions. Additional deductions may include health insurance, conveyance allowance, and other benefits. The result is your net salary - the actual amount you'll receive in your bank account after all deductions.",
