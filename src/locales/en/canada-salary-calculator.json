  "howSalaryAfterTaxWorksCanada": "Salary after tax in Canada involves several key deductions from your gross pay. Federal income tax is calculated using progressive tax brackets based on your taxable income. Provincial income tax varies significantly by province, from 0% in some territories to over 20% in high-tax provinces like Newfoundland and Labrador. Canada Pension Plan (CPP) contributions are required for most employees (5.95% up to the maximum pensionable earnings). Employment Insurance (EI) premiums are also deducted (1.63% up to the maximum insurable earnings). Optional deductions like RRSP contributions can further reduce your taxable income and increase your take-home pay.",
