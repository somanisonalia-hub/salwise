  "howThisCalculatorWorks": "This UK hourly to salary calculator converts your hourly wage to annual, monthly, and weekly equivalents while accounting for UK tax deductions. First, it calculates your gross annual salary by multiplying hourly rate × hours per week × 52 weeks. Then it applies UK 2026 tax rates: PAYE income tax (20%, 40%, or 45% across bands after £12,570 Personal Allowance), National Insurance (8% and 2% rates), and optional deductions like pension contributions and student loans. The result shows both gross and net salary figures so you can understand your true take-home pay. Holiday pay and other benefits are not included in this calculation.",
