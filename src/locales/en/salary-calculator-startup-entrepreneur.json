  "howStartupEntrepreneurSalariesAreCalculated": "Startup and entrepreneur salaries typically include gross revenue minus business expenses, then standard deductions. Gross revenue is calculated from business income, minus legitimate business expenses like office supplies, marketing, equipment, and software. Standard deductions include income tax, self-employment tax, and optional deductions like retirement contributions, health insurance, and professional liability insurance. The result is your net salary - the actual amount you'll receive in your bank account after all deductions.",
