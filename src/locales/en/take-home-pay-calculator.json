  "whatIsTakeHomePay": "Take-home pay, also known as net pay or net income, represents the actual amount of money you receive after all required deductions are taken from your gross earnings. Unlike gross salary which includes your total compensation, take-home pay accounts for various withholdings including income taxes, Social Security contributions, Medicare taxes, and other mandatory or voluntary deductions. Understanding your take-home pay is crucial for effective financial planning and accurate budgeting.",
  "howThisIrelandSalaryCalculatorWorks": "This Ireland salary calculator works by taking your gross salary and applying the relevant Irish tax calculations step by step. First, your gross annual salary is calculated from your pay frequency. Then PAYE income tax is calculated using Ireland's progressive tax bands: 20% on the first €42,335, 40% on income between €42,336 and €70,557, and 48% on income over €70,557. Next, Universal Social Charge (USC) is applied with rates ranging from 0.5% to 8% depending on your income level. Pay Related Social Insurance (PRSI) contributions are then calculated at the standard employee rate. The calculator subtracts these mandatory deductions from your gross pay to show your net take-home salary, helping you understand exactly how much you'll receive after all Irish taxes and social insurance contributions.",
