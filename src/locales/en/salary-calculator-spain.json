  "howSalaryAfterTaxWorksSpain": "Salary after tax in Spain involves several mandatory deductions from your gross pay. Income tax is calculated using progressive tax brackets based on your taxable income. Social security contributions include contributions to the pension system, unemployment insurance, and other social benefits. These contributions are shared between employees and employers, but the calculator shows the employee portion. Optional deductions like pension contributions can further reduce your taxable income and increase your take-home pay. The result is your net salary - the actual amount you'll receive in your bank account.",
