  "intro": "Understanding your Equated Monthly Installment (EMI) is crucial for effective loan planning. An EMI represents the fixed monthly payment amount you need to pay towards your loan, which includes both principal and interest components. Our calculator helps you understand how loan amount, interest rate, and tenure affect your monthly payments, enabling you to make informed borrowing decisions for home loans, car loans, personal loans, and other financing needs.",

  "howEmiIsCalculated": "EMI (Equated Monthly Installment) is calculated using the standard loan amortization formula: EMI = [P x R x (1+R)^N] / [(1+R)^N - 1], where P is the principal loan amount, R is the monthly interest rate (annual rate divided by 12), and N is the number of monthly installments. The total interest paid over the loan tenure is the difference between total payment (EMI x N) and the original loan amount. This formula ensures equal monthly payments throughout the loan term.",
