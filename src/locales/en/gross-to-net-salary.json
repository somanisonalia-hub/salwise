  "intro": "Understanding the difference between gross and net salary is crucial for financial planning.

  "whatIsGrossVsNet": "Gross salary refers to your total compensation before any deductions are taken out. It's the amount your employer agrees to pay you for your work. Net salary, on the other hand, is your take-home pay - the amount you actually receive in your bank account after taxes, social security contributions, health insurance premiums, and other withholdings have been deducted. Typical deductions include federal and state income taxes, Social Security (FICA) contributions, Medicare taxes, and sometimes retirement plan contributions or health insurance premiums.",
  "howGrossConvertsToNet": "Converting gross salary to net pay involves applying your estimated tax rate and subtracting other deductions. We start with your gross earnings, calculate the applicable taxes based on the tax rate you provide, and subtract any additional deductions you specify. The result is your estimated net or take-home pay. Keep in mind that actual calculations may vary based on your specific tax situation, filing status, and additional benefits or deductions.",
