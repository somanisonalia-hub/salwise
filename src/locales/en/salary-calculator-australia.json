  "howSalaryAfterTaxWorksAustralia": "Salary after tax in Australia involves deductions from your gross pay. Federal income tax is calculated using progressive tax brackets based on your taxable income. The Medicare levy is a 2% tax on most Australian taxpayers to fund Medicare healthcare. Optional deductions like superannuation (retirement savings) and private health insurance can further reduce your taxable income and increase your take-home pay. The result is your net salary - the actual amount you'll receive in your bank account.",
