  "whatDoesNetToGrossMean": "Net to gross salary conversion is the reverse process of the more common gross to net calculation. While gross salary represents your total compensation before any deductions, net salary is what you actually receive after taxes and withholdings are subtracted. The net to gross calculation works backwards: starting from your desired net income and adding back the estimated taxes and deductions to determine what gross salary would be required to achieve that take-home amount. This is particularly useful when job offers are quoted as net amounts or when you need to compare different compensation packages on an apples-to-apples basis.",
  "howNetConvertsToGross": "Our calculator starts with your desired net take-home pay and works backwards through the deduction process. We add back the estimated income tax based on the tax rate you provide, then include any additional deductions you've specified. The result is the gross salary you would need to earn to receive your target net amount. This reverse engineering approach gives you clarity on the true cost of achieving your desired take-home pay, making salary negotiations and financial planning much more precise.",
