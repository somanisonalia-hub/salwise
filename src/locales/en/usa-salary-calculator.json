  "howSalaryAfterTaxWorksUSA": "Salary after tax in the USA involves several key deductions from your gross pay. Federal income tax is calculated based on tax brackets and filing status. State income tax varies significantly by state, from 0% in Texas and Florida to over 10% in California and New York. Social Security tax (6.2%) and Medicare tax (1.45%) are withheld for most employees. Optional deductions like 401(k) contributions, health insurance premiums, and other pre-tax benefits can further reduce your taxable income and increase your take-home pay.",
