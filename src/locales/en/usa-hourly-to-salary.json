  "howThisCalculatorWorks": "This USA hourly to salary calculator converts your hourly wage to annual, monthly, and weekly equivalents while accounting for US tax deductions. First, it calculates your gross annual salary by multiplying hourly rate × hours per week × 52 weeks. Then it applies 2026 federal income tax using progressive brackets (10%-37%), state income tax based on your selected state (0% in Texas to 13.3% in California), Social Security tax (6.2%), Medicare tax (1.45%), and optional deductions like 401(k) contributions. The result shows both gross and net salary figures so you can understand your true take-home pay. Holiday pay and other benefits are not included in this calculation.",
