  "intro": "Understanding your take-home pay is essential for effective financial planning and budgeting. Your take-home pay represents the actual amount you receive in your bank account after all taxes, social contributions, and deductions are subtracted from your gross salary. Whether you're an employee, freelancer, or self-employed individual, knowing how to calculate this figure accurately helps you make informed decisions about spending, saving, and financial goals.",
  "step1IdentifyGrossSalary": "Your gross salary is the total amount you earn before any deductions. This includes your base salary, allowances, overtime pay, bonuses, commissions, and any other taxable income. For employees, this is typically listed on your payslip or employment contract. For freelancers and self-employed individuals, gross income includes all revenue from services provided before deducting business expenses. Understanding your gross salary is the foundation for calculating your take-home pay.",
  "step2CalculateTaxes": "Taxes are one of the largest deductions from your gross salary. Income tax rates vary by country and are typically progressive (higher income = higher tax rate). In addition to income tax, most countries require social security contributions, national insurance, or similar mandatory deductions. These are usually split between employer and employee contributions. The exact rates depend on your location, income level, and employment status.",
  "step3DeductOtherExpenses": "Beyond taxes and mandatory contributions, several other deductions can reduce your take-home pay. These include retirement contributions (401k, IRA, pension schemes), health insurance premiums, union dues, charitable donations, and garnishments. Some deductions may be pre-tax (reducing your taxable income) while others are post-tax. Understanding which deductions apply to your situation is crucial for accurate calculations.",
  "step4CalculateNetSalary": "Net salary, or take-home pay, is calculated using this simple formula: Net Salary = Gross Salary - Taxes - Mandatory Contributions - Other Deductions. The result is the amount you actually receive. This calculation can be done monthly or annually, but monthly calculations are often more practical for budgeting. Remember that net salary can fluctuate due to changes in tax brackets, additional income, or deduction adjustments.",
