  "howHourlyConvertsToSalary": "Hourly pay converts to salary through a straightforward calculation: multiply your hourly rate by the number of hours you work per week, then multiply that by the number of weeks you work per year. For example, if you earn €20 per hour and work 40 hours per week for 52 weeks, your annual salary would be €20 × 40 × 52 = €41,600. This calculation provides a clear picture of your total compensation and makes it easy to compare different employment opportunities.",
