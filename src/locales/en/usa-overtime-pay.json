  "intro": "Calculate your overtime pay in the USA with our comprehensive tax calculator. Understanding how overtime is taxed is crucial for maximizing your take-home earnings from extra hours worked. US law requires overtime to be paid at time-and-a-half (1.5x) or double time (2x) your normal hourly rate for hours worked over 40 per week under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). This calculator uses official 2026 IRS rates to show you exactly how much tax you'll pay on overtime earnings, including federal income tax, state income tax, Social Security tax (6.2%), Medicare tax (1.45%), and 401(k) contributions. Whether you work occasional overtime or regularly put in extra hours, this tool helps you understand the true value of your overtime work.",

  "howThisCalculatorWorks": "This USA overtime pay calculator determines your take-home overtime earnings by first calculating the gross overtime pay (base salary ÷ 52 weeks ÷ contracted hours × overtime hours × overtime multiplier), then applying US tax rates. Overtime is taxed at your marginal federal rate plus state taxes, potentially pushing you into higher tax brackets. Social Security and Medicare are calculated on total earnings. The calculator shows both the overtime pay breakdown and your total salary including overtime, so you can see the overall tax impact. US federal law requires time-and-a-half for hours over 40/week, though individual contracts may specify different rates.",

    {
      "question": "How is overtime taxed in the USA?",
      "answer": "Overtime pay is taxed at your marginal federal income tax rate plus state income tax, Social Security (6.2%), and Medicare (1.45%). It doesn't receive special tax treatment - it's taxed the same as regular wages."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the federal overtime rate in the USA?",
      "answer": "Under the FLSA, non-exempt employees must receive time-and-a-half (1.5x their regular rate) for hours worked over 40 in a workweek. Some states require double-time for excessive overtime hours."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does overtime affect my tax bracket?",
      "answer": "Yes, overtime increases your total annual earnings, potentially pushing you into higher federal tax brackets (from 22% to 24%, etc.) and state tax brackets. The overtime itself is taxed at your new marginal rate."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are salaried employees eligible for overtime?",
      "answer": "It depends on their job duties and salary level. Many salaried employees are exempt from overtime under FLSA if they meet certain criteria (duties test and salary threshold currently $43,888/year)."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I calculate my overtime rate?",
      "answer": "Divide your annual salary by 2,080 (52 weeks × 40 hours) to get your regular hourly rate. Multiply by 1.5 for time-and-a-half or 2.0 for double-time overtime rates."
