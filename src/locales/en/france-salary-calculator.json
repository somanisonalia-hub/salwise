  "howSalaryAfterTaxWorksFrance": "Salary after tax in France involves several mandatory deductions from your gross pay. Income tax is calculated using progressive tax brackets based on your taxable income. Social contributions include health insurance (sickness insurance), pension contributions, unemployment insurance, and solidarity taxes (CSG and CRDS). These contributions are applied at varying rates depending on income level. Optional deductions like additional pension contributions or private insurance can further reduce your taxable income and increase your take-home pay. The result is your net salary - the actual amount you'll receive in your bank account.",
