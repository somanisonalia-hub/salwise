  "howBonusesAreCalculated": "Bonus calculations start with your gross bonus amount and apply various tax deductions. First, federal income tax is calculated based on your tax bracket. Then, FICA taxes (Social Security and Medicare) are applied at the full rate. State income tax may also apply depending on your location. The result is your net bonus - the actual amount you'll receive in your paycheck or bank account.",
