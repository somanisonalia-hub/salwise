  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between Ltd and umbrella companies?",
      "answer": "Ltd companies are your own limited company where you invoice clients and pay corporation tax. Umbrella companies employ you and handle tax/PAYE deductions, but take a margin for their services."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which option is more tax-efficient?",
      "answer": "Ltd companies are often more tax-efficient for higher earners due to lower effective tax rates on dividends. Umbrella companies may be simpler for occasional contractors."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the costs of running an Ltd company?",
      "answer": "Annual costs include accounting fees (€1,200-2,000), registered office (€300-600), and corporation tax filing. Umbrella companies charge 5-8% margin."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need to register for VAT?",
      "answer": "If your annual turnover exceeds €75,000, you must register for VAT. Umbrella companies handle this automatically."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I claim expenses as a contractor?",
      "answer": "Yes, you can claim legitimate business expenses like travel, equipment, and home office costs. Keep detailed records and receipts."
