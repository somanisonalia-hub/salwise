  "howThisUKSalaryCalculatorWorks": "This UK salary calculator works by taking your gross salary and applying all relevant UK tax calculations step by step. First, your gross annual salary is calculated from your pay frequency. Then PAYE income tax is calculated using the UK's progressive tax bands: 20% on the first £12,570-£50,270, 40% on income £50,271-£150,000, and 45% on income over £150,000. National Insurance contributions are applied at Class 1 rates: 8% on earnings £12,570-£50,270 and 2% above that. Additional deductions like pension contributions (which are tax-relievable) and student loan repayments are factored in. The calculator follows official HMRC calculation methods for reliable financial planning across England, Scotland, and Wales.",

    },
