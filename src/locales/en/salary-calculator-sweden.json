  "howSalaryAfterTaxWorksSweden": "Salary after tax in Sweden involves several mandatory deductions from your gross pay. Income tax is calculated using a progressive system with municipal and national tax rates. Social security contributions are automatically deducted and include contributions for pensions, healthcare, and unemployment insurance. These contributions are shared between employees and employers, but the calculator shows the employee portion. Optional deductions like additional pension contributions can further reduce your taxable income and increase your take-home pay. The result is your net salary - the actual amount you'll receive in your bank account.",
