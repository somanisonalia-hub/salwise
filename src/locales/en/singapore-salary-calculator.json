  "howSalaryAfterTaxWorksSingapore": "Salary after tax in Singapore involves several mandatory deductions from your gross pay. Income tax is calculated using progressive tax rates based on your annual taxable income. Central Provident Fund (CPF) contributions are mandatory for Singapore citizens and permanent residents, with rates varying by age. Employees contribute a portion of their salary to CPF for retirement savings, housing, and healthcare. Optional deductions like additional insurance or savings plans can further reduce your taxable income. The result is your net salary - the actual amount you'll receive in your bank account.",
