  "intro": "Calculate your bonus tax in the UK with our comprehensive calculator. Bonuses are a significant part of many UK salaries, but understanding how they're taxed is crucial for accurate financial planning. Unlike regular salary, bonuses are taxed at your marginal PAYE rate, potentially pushing you into higher tax brackets. This calculator uses official 2026 HMRC rates to show you exactly how much tax you'll pay on bonuses, including PAYE income tax, National Insurance contributions (NIC), and pension deductions. Whether you're expecting a year-end bonus, performance bonus, or other supplemental pay, this tool helps you understand your true take-home bonus amount and overall compensation package.",

  "howThisCalculatorWorks": "This UK bonus tax calculator determines your take-home bonus by adding the bonus to your annual salary, then calculating UK taxes on the total amount. Bonuses are taxed at marginal rates - if your base salary puts you in the 20% bracket but the bonus pushes you into the 40% bracket, the entire bonus is taxed at 40%. National Insurance is calculated on total earnings. The calculator shows both the bonus tax breakdown and your total salary including bonus, helping you understand the overall tax impact. UK bonuses are typically paid as a lump sum and taxed under the PAYE system.",
