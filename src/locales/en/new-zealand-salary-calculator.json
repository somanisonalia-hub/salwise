  "howSalaryAfterTaxWorksNewZealand": "Salary after tax in New Zealand involves several mandatory deductions from your gross pay. Income tax is calculated using progressive tax brackets based on your taxable income. ACC (Accident Compensation Corporation) levies provide coverage for work-related injuries and illnesses. These levies are shared between employees and employers, but the calculator shows the employee portion. Optional deductions like KiwiSaver retirement savings can further reduce your taxable income and increase your take-home pay. The result is your net salary - the actual amount you'll receive in your bank account.",
