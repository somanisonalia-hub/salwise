  "howOvertimePayIsCalculated": "Overtime pay is calculated by multiplying your overtime hours by your regular hourly rate, then applying the overtime multiplier (typically 1.5x for time-and-a-half). For example, if you earn €20 per hour and work 10 overtime hours at 1.5x, your overtime pay would be €20 × 10 × 1.5 = €300. You can also apply an optional tax rate to see your net overtime earnings after deductions.",
