  "intro": "Calculate your overtime pay in Ireland with our comprehensive tax calculator. Understanding how overtime is taxed is crucial for maximizing your take-home earnings from extra hours worked. Irish law typically requires overtime to be paid at time-and-a-half (1.5x) or double time (2x) your normal hourly rate, but these payments are taxed at your marginal rate, potentially pushing you into higher tax brackets. This calculator uses official 2026 Revenue.ie rates to show you exactly how much tax you'll pay on overtime earnings, including PAYE income tax, Universal Social Charge (USC), and Pay Related Social Insurance (PRSI) contributions. Whether you work occasional overtime or regularly put in extra hours, this tool helps you understand the true value of your overtime work.",

  "howThisCalculatorWorks": "This Ireland overtime pay calculator determines your take-home overtime earnings by first calculating the gross overtime pay (base salary ÷ 52 weeks ÷ contracted hours × overtime hours × overtime multiplier), then applying Irish tax rates. Overtime is taxed at your marginal PAYE rate - if your regular salary puts you in the 20% bracket but overtime pushes you into the 40% bracket, the overtime is taxed at 40%. USC and PRSI are calculated on total earnings. The calculator shows both the overtime pay breakdown and your total salary including overtime, so you can see the overall tax impact. Irish employment law generally requires overtime rates of 1.5x for weekdays and 2x for weekends/holidays, though individual contracts may vary.",
