## 🚨 Critical Rules for Verification

- ✅ **ALLOWED**: Only URLs listed in this table
- ❌ **NOT ALLOWED**: Any links to Canada, Australia, India, or industry-specific calculators
- ❌ **NOT ALLOWED**: Any links to removed financial calculators (bonus, overtime, loan, etc.)
- ❌ **NOT ALLOWED**: Any external links except the 5 approved ones listed

This table represents the complete, verified UI state for AdSense compliance.

**Note**: User specified 45 pages for Phase 1, but current implementation has 35 pages. This discrepancy may be due to:
- Including individual guide subpages under /guides/ route as separate counts
- Counting 45 pages for English locale only (excluding es/fr locales)
- Additional informational pages to be added

Current build generates 88 pages total (29-30 pages × 3 locales).
