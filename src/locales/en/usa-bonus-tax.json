  "intro": "Calculate your bonus tax in the USA with our comprehensive calculator. Bonuses are a significant part of many US salaries, but understanding how they're taxed is crucial for accurate financial planning. Unlike regular salary, bonuses are taxed at your marginal federal rate plus state taxes, potentially pushing you into higher tax brackets. This calculator uses official 2026 IRS rates to show you exactly how much tax you'll pay on bonuses, including federal income tax, state income tax, Social Security tax (6.2%), Medicare tax (1.45%), and 401(k) contributions. Whether you're expecting a year-end bonus, performance bonus, or other supplemental pay, this tool helps you understand your true take-home bonus amount and overall compensation package.",

  "howThisCalculatorWorks": "This USA bonus tax calculator determines your take-home bonus by adding the bonus to your annual salary, then calculating US taxes on the total amount. Bonuses are taxed at marginal rates - if your base salary puts you in the 22% bracket but the bonus pushes you into the 24% bracket, the entire bonus is taxed at 24%. State taxes, Social Security, and Medicare are calculated on total earnings. The calculator shows both the bonus tax breakdown and your total salary including bonus, helping you understand the overall tax impact. US bonuses are typically paid as a lump sum and taxed under federal and state income tax rules.",

    {
      "question": "How are bonuses taxed in the USA?",
      "answer": "Bonuses are added to your annual salary and taxed at your marginal federal income tax rate plus state income tax, Social Security (6.2%), and Medicare (1.45%). They don't receive special tax treatment - they're taxed the same as regular wages."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are bonuses taxed differently from salary?",
      "answer": "No, bonuses are taxed the same as regular salary under US federal tax rules, but at marginal rates rather than being averaged across the year. This can result in bonuses being taxed at higher effective rates than your standard salary."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I reduce bonus tax through retirement contributions?",
      "answer": "Yes, you can increase 401(k) contributions around bonus time to reduce your taxable income. However, 401(k) contribution limits apply annually, so plan ahead to maximize tax advantages."
    },
    {
      "question": "When are bonuses usually paid in the USA?",
      "answer": "Bonuses in the US are typically paid annually, often at year-end (December/January) or following the company's fiscal year-end. Some companies pay quarterly or half-yearly bonuses."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do bonuses affect my tax bracket?",
      "answer": "Yes, bonuses increase your total income, which may push you into higher federal tax brackets and state tax brackets. Higher income levels can result in bonuses being taxed at rates up to 37% federal plus state taxes."
