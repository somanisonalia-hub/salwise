  "howThisUSASalaryCalculatorWorks": "This USA salary calculator works by taking your gross salary and applying all relevant US tax calculations step by step. First, your gross annual salary is calculated from your pay frequency. Then federal income tax is calculated using 2026 tax brackets: 10% on the first $11,600, 12% on $11,601-$47,150, 22% on $47,151-$100,525, and higher rates above that. State income tax is added based on your selected state (from 0% in Texas to over 13% in California). Social Security tax (6.2%) and Medicare tax (1.45%) are applied to most employees. Additional deductions like 401(k) contributions (which are tax-relievable) and other annual deductions are factored in. The calculator follows official IRS calculation methods for reliable financial planning across all US states.",
