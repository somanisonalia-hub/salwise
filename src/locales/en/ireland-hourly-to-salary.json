  "howThisCalculatorWorks": "This Ireland hourly to salary calculator converts your hourly wage to annual, monthly, and weekly equivalents while accounting for Irish tax deductions. First, it calculates your gross annual salary by multiplying hourly rate × hours per week × 52 weeks. Then it applies Ireland's 2026 tax rates: PAYE income tax (20% on first €42,335, 40% on €42,336-€70,557, 45% above), Universal Social Charge (0.5%-8% across brackets), and PRSI (4% for most employees). The result shows both gross and net salary figures so you can understand your true take-home pay. Holiday pay and other benefits are not included in this calculation.",
