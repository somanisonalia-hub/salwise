  "intro": "Understanding the difference between gross and net salary is fundamental to effective financial planning and budgeting. Gross salary represents your total earnings before any deductions, while net salary is the amount you actually receive after taxes and other withholdings. This guide will help you understand these concepts clearly, so you can make informed decisions about your compensation, budget effectively, and plan for your financial future.",
  "whatIsGrossSalary": "Gross salary is your total earnings before any deductions or withholdings. This includes your base salary, allowances, bonuses, overtime pay, commissions, and any other taxable income. For employees, gross salary is typically listed on your employment contract or offer letter. For freelancers and self-employed individuals, gross income refers to all revenue from services before deducting business expenses or taxes. Gross salary serves as the starting point for calculating your net (take-home) pay.",
  "whatIsNetSalary": "Net salary, also known as take-home pay, is the amount you actually receive in your bank account after all deductions have been subtracted from your gross salary. This includes mandatory deductions like income tax and social security contributions, as well as voluntary deductions such as retirement contributions, health insurance premiums, and other benefits. Net salary is the real amount available for your day-to-day expenses, savings, and discretionary spending.",

    "Income tax: Progressive tax rates based on your total income and tax bracket",
