  "howSalaryAfterTaxWorksUK": "Salary after tax in the UK involves several key deductions from your gross pay. Income tax is calculated using progressive tax bands: Personal Allowance (tax-free up to £12,570), Basic rate (20% on income £12,571-£50,270), Higher rate (40% on income £50,271-£150,000), and Additional rate (45% on income over £150,000). National Insurance contributions are also deducted at rates of 8% for earnings between £12,570-£50,270 and 2% above that. Optional deductions like pension contributions and student loan repayments can further reduce your taxable income and increase your take-home pay.",
