For freelancers and self-employed individuals, gross income refers to all revenue from services before deducting business expenses or taxes. Gross salary serves as the starting point for calculating your net (take-home) pay.",

This includes mandatory deductions like income tax and social security contributions, as well as voluntary deductions such as retirement contributions, health insurance premiums, and other benefits. Net salary is the real amount available for your day-to-day expenses, savings, and discretionary spending.",
