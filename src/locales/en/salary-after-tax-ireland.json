  "howSalaryAfterTaxWorksIreland": "Salary after tax in Ireland involves several key deductions from your gross pay. Income tax is calculated using progressive tax bands: Entry (20% on income up to €42,335), Middle (40% on income €42,336-€70,557), and Higher (48% on income over €70,557). Universal Social Charge (USC) is applied at varying rates from 0.5% to 8% depending on income level. Pay Related Social Insurance (PRSI) contributions are also deducted. Optional deductions like pension contributions and health insurance can further reduce your taxable income and increase your take-home pay.",
