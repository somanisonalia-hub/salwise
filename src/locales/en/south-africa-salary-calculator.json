  "howSalaryAfterTaxWorksSouthAfrica": "Salary after tax in South Africa involves several mandatory deductions from your gross pay. Income tax is calculated using progressive tax brackets based on your taxable income. The Unemployment Insurance Fund (UIF) is a mandatory contribution that provides benefits in case of unemployment. These contributions are shared between employees and employers, but the calculator shows the employee portion. Optional deductions like retirement annuity funds and medical aid can further reduce your taxable income and increase your take-home pay. The result is your net salary - the actual amount you'll receive in your bank account.",
