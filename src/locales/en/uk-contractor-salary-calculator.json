  "howThisCalculatorWorks": "This UK contractor salary calculator compares two common UK contracting structures: Ltd company (where you work through your own limited company) and umbrella company (where you work through an agency's payroll). For Ltd companies, it calculates corporation tax (25%), director's salary, and dividends. For umbrella companies, it calculates PAYE tax, NIC, and pension contributions on your full rate. The calculator accounts for expenses and other deductions to show you the true take-home pay for each structure. UK contractors typically work through these structures to optimize tax efficiency, with Ltd companies often providing better net returns for higher earners.",
