  "whatIsTakeHomePay": "Take-home pay, also known as net pay or net income, represents the actual amount of money you receive after all required deductions are taken from your gross earnings. Unlike gross salary which includes your total compensation, take-home pay accounts for various withholdings including income taxes, Social Security contributions, Medicare taxes, and other mandatory or voluntary deductions. Understanding your take-home pay is crucial for effective financial planning and accurate budgeting.",
  "howCalculatorWorks": "Our take-home pay calculator starts with your gross income and applies estimated tax rates based on standard tax brackets. We then subtract common deductions like federal and state income taxes, FICA contributions, and any additional withholdings you specify. The result is your estimated net pay - the actual amount you'll see deposited in your account. We provide both monthly and annual breakdowns for comprehensive financial planning.",
