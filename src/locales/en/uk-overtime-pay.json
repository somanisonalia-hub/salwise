  "intro": "Calculate your overtime pay in the UK with our comprehensive tax calculator. Understanding how overtime is taxed is crucial for maximizing your take-home earnings from extra hours worked. UK law typically requires overtime to be paid at time-and-a-half (1.5x) or double time (2x) your normal hourly rate, but these payments are taxed at your marginal PAYE rate, potentially pushing you into higher tax brackets. This calculator uses official 2026 HMRC rates to show you exactly how much tax you'll pay on overtime earnings, including PAYE income tax, National Insurance contributions (NIC), and pension deductions. Whether you work occasional overtime or regularly put in extra hours, this tool helps you understand the true value of your overtime work.",

  "howThisCalculatorWorks": "This UK overtime pay calculator determines your take-home overtime earnings by first calculating the gross overtime pay (base salary ÷ 52 weeks ÷ contracted hours × overtime hours × overtime multiplier), then applying UK tax rates. Overtime is taxed at your marginal rate - if your regular salary puts you in the 20% bracket but overtime pushes you into the 40% bracket, the overtime is taxed at 40%. National Insurance is calculated on total earnings. The calculator shows both the overtime pay breakdown and your total salary including overtime, so you can see the overall tax impact. UK employment law generally requires overtime rates of 1.5x for weekdays and 2x for weekends/holidays, though individual contracts may vary.",
